add irc command: !cq to clear queues
	this is especially for the irc backlog buffer, so the bots can send faster because of server flooding limits
	i think this is solved now but have to check again!

add irc command: !abort SMOKERNAME in public, !abort in private
	that way the smoker cleanly deletes current job/queue/etc

add irc command: !die SMOKERNAME in pub, !die in priv
	cleanly shutdown the bot - a way for the supervisor(Kerrigan-like) concept to manage the bots

POE::Component::Metabase::Relay
	relayd_registered use inet_ntoa for the case of listening on '0'

	in START, why do we need to fix $$sender instead of $sender in the source? something funky with MX::POE?

metabase_relay.pl
	don't store just IP in reports, do a real DNS resolve so we can store both in different columns for easier lookup!

	colorize colorize FAIL in irc!

	recurring daily rotate the CPANTesters.db file and compress n etc?

	DO NOT dump all PASS to irc, just FAIL or etc, and do this every min - similar to "last message seen X times" in syslog or whatever
		"summary: received X PASSES from Y smokers"

	I saw a case where it took literally minutes to startup! I suspect some sqlite commands on a big file stalled my code?

ci_bot.pl
	when it prints "finished smoking block" in IRC, the time is totally wrong!

when I start making windows VMs and smoke based on strawberry, make CPAN::Perl::Releases::Strawberry or something?

CPAN BAD DISTS
--------------
What are they? They are dists that the smoker killed for some reason. I'll investigate them at some point in the future in the hope of being
able to smoke them! No need to "blacklist" or whatever, I have full faith that smokebox will be able to catch errors and move on.
