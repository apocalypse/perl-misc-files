generic steps
-------------
	extract tarball
	apply version-specific patches
	sh Configure -des -Dprefix=/home/apoc/perl/perl-5.x.x
	make depend
	make test
	make install
	cd /home/apoc/perl/perl-5.x.x


5.6.2
-----
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2007/08/msg127609.html
	to fix the asm/page.h error

	http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/2bce232
	http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/a9ff62c8
		to fix configure problems
		be sure to remove all instances of "command-line" and "built-in" in the makefile

	also use -Ui_db argument to sh Configure so we disable DB_File

	<Apocalypse> The following 1 signals are available: SIGZERO
	<Apocalypse> funny heh
	<Apocalypse> /usr/bin/sort: open failed: +1: No such file or directory
	<Bram> Hmm. That could be a problem with a newer version of sort.. I remember seeing a Change of it a long time ago but again don't fully remember...
	<Bram> In Configure (on 5.6.1): replace the first  $sort -n +1  with:  ($sort -n -k 2 2>/dev/null || $sort -n +1) |\  and the second with  $sort -n
		do that to fix signal problem

5.6.1
-----
	same as 5.6.2

5.6.0
-----
	same as 5.6.2




<Apocalypse> So it is safe to ignore or it would screw up my smoking of 5.8.8?
<@Bram> It appears to be a test that is broken with 64 bit int (which you are using). So try removing the test or modify it to match the test on 5.8.9
<@Bram> What smoking? (cpan smoking? perl smoking?)
<Apocalypse> Sorry, cpan smoking
<Apocalypse> No use in smoking old perl builds, I'll also setup a blead smoker sometime in the future :)
<@Bram> As far as I can tell it won't mess up your cpan smoking... it's only a problem if large numbers in sprintf are used..
<@Bram> Or your could recompile the perl to be 32int instead of 64int (then the test passes but the underlying problem with sprintf still exists)
<Apocalypse> Ah, so the underlying bug really is fixed in 5.8.9+ or it is still lurking?
<rjbs> Apocalypse: http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1812 -- boggle
<+dipsy> [ rjbs's rubric: remarkable behavior of sprintf ]
<@Bram> From the commits it appears to be fixed
<Apocalypse> rjbs: :)
<Apocalypse> Bram: I'll make a note of that and if any cpan modules bombs on < 5.8.9 due to sprintf problems I'll know what's going on :)
